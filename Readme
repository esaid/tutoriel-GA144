4.2.2 HTML Listings
Load the HTML utility with html load . The default output filename is cf.html . You can change this name from
the command prompt if you like by typing, for example, named my.html . Then type first last+2 run , where
first and last+2 are block numbers. The result is an html file with shadow blocks on the left side and code blocks
on the right. For example, to produce a listing of an entire colorForth floppy image, type 18 1440 run . The colors
have been altered only so that the background can be white and comments black. This saves black toner or ink when
printing the listings.


4.2.3 Index Listing
Load the indexing utility with index load . The default output filename is index.txt . You can change this name
from the command prompt if you like by typing, for example, named my.txt . Then type first last+2 run ,
where first and last+2 are block numbers. An index is the top line (approximately) of each block in the range
specified. No colors are indicated, just text.


html load 
18 1440 run




4.2.4 PNG Screen Captures
The PNG utility is resident in colorForth. You can capture the screen as a .png file at any time by typing png at the
command prompt. A png file will be created with the default name of OkadOut.gds . You will probably want to
rename this to something more appropriate, with a .png extension.
PNG is appropriate when the screen contains graphics other than a source block. The HTML utility is more suitable for
source code.


4.3 The Bonus Materials
Some of the "study material" supplied on this disk image may be executed to do useful things, as follow:
selftest (n) If the ATS materials supplied in 480 to 720 are still intact, this phrase will run all relevant ATS
tests on the chip whose IDE COM port number is given. Note that in order to test the Host chip in this
way, its no-boot jumper J26 must be installed before running selftest or the IDE will hang.
autotest (n) Again if the ATS materials are intact, this will cause the Host chip to run ATS tests on the
Target chip using the same general procedure as does the factory chip tester, by running tests
through the synchronous connection between each chip's node 300. In addition, it runs SERDES test
between Host node 701 and Target node 001, transferring a quarter million words of known unique
values each way and verifying correct receipt with line turn-arounds.
